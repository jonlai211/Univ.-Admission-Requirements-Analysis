Application Requirements
========================

Overview
--------

We look forward to learning about you through your application.

Here you'll find a detailed explanation of each admission application requirement. **Most of the information here
applies to both first-year and transfer applicants, and requirements are the same for domestic and international
applicants.**

Don't forget to reference our [**Application Tips**](/guides/application-tips "Application Tips - Guide")
for guidance on filling out the Common Application.

Application
-----------

We accept the [Common Application](https://www.commonapp.org/explore/harvard-university)and
the [Coalition Application by Scoir](https://app.scoir.com/app/signup/2100353)
. Both are treated equally by the Admissions Committee. Complete and submit your materials as soon as possible to ensure
full and timely consideration of your application. Your portions of the application are due by the application
deadlines (November 1 for Restrictive Early Action and January 1 for Regular Decision); high school counselors are given
an additional week to submit materials on your behalf.

**If you use the Common Application**, you must submit your application before your supporting materials (Secondary
School Report, Teacher Recommendations, etc.) can be released to a college. Until you submit your own application
sections, no part of your application will be transmitted to the Harvard Admissions Office.

**If you use the Coalition Application**, remember you must submit the separate Harvard supplement in addition to the
application by the application deadline for your application to be considered complete.

### Submitting Your Application

*   #### Receiving confirmation of your application

    After you submit your application, we will send an email confirmation with a PIN to access the Applicant Portal. We
    begin sending these daily application confirmation emails in mid-September each year. Most applicant receive their
    confirmation email the day after they submit their application online. Applications sent in the mail will take up to
    two weeks to process.

    If you have not received your confirmation email, please check your spam/junk folder for messages from
    college@fas.harvard.edu or fileroom@fas.harvard.edu.If have searched your inbox and still cannot find your
    confirmation email, we encourage you to check the application system you used and ensure you clicked "Submit" and
    not just "Save".

    If you still cannot locate your application confirmation email,
    please [contact us](https://college.harvard.edu/contact-us)
    . Choose the category “Admissions” and then the subject “Applicant Questions (if you've already submitted your
    application)” in the drop-down menu, or call 617-495-1551.

*   #### Paying the application fee or requesting a fee waiver

    You may pay your application fee online with a credit card via the Common Application or Coalition Application,
    Powered by Scoir websites.

    You may also send a check or money order to Harvard College Admissions, 86 Brattle Street, Cambridge, MA 02138.
    Please include the applicant’s name with the payment.

    **Fee waivers:** We are committed to making the application process accessible for all students. If the admissions
    application fee presents a hardship for you or your family and you plan on applying for financial aid, the fee will
    be
    waived. [Please follow these instructions to request your fee waiver](https://college.harvard.edu/resources/faq/paying-admissions-application-fee-hardship-my-family-can-i-get-waiver)
    . Requesting a fee waiver will not disadvantage your application in any way.

*   #### Completing the Harvard supplement questions

    Complete the Harvard Questions with the Common Application or Coalition Application, Powered by Scoir\*. This
    includes the following five required short-answer questions, each with a 200 word limit.

                                                                                extracurricular activities, employment
                                                                                experience, travel, or family
                                                                                responsibilities that have shaped who
                                                                                you are.
    4. How do you hope to use your Harvard education in the future?
    5. Top 3 things your roommates might like to know about you.
    \*Please note that the Harvard supplement is separate for the Coalition Application, so you must submit both the
    application AND supplement for your application to be considered complete.

### Additional application questions

*   #### What if I am homeschooled?

    Each applicant to Harvard College is considered with great care and homeschooled applicants are treated the same as
    all other applicants. There is no special process, but all relevant information about your educational and personal
    background is welcome. In addition to the application, all applicants are required to submit a transcript (which can
    be created by the family member or agency overseeing your schooling), and recommendations. If the application fee
    presents a hardship for your
    family,[simply request a fee waiver](http://college.harvard.edu/resources/faq/paying-admissions-application-fee-hardship-my-family-can-i-get-waiver)
    .

    Hear from Harvard students who were homeschooled, in the Harvard Gazette
    article ‘[Homeschooled en route to Harvard](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2018/02/three-harvard-students-on-lessons-of-homeschooling/)
    .’

*   #### What if I need to make updates to my application after I submit it?

    Do not resend your application in order to make updates. If you need to update your identification or contact
    information, or send updates, additional information, or corrections, please do so via
    the[Applicant Portal](https://apply.college.harvard.edu/status)
    .

*   #### Misrepresentation of Credentials

    Be completely accurate in your application materials. If we discover a misrepresentation during the admissions
    process, you will be denied admission. If you have already been admitted, your offer will typically be withdrawn. If
    you have already registered, your admission will normally be revoked, and we will require you to leave the College.
    Harvard rescinds degrees if misrepresentations in application materials are discovered.

    The determination that an application is inaccurate or contains misrepresentations rests solely with the Admissions
    Office and will be resolved outside the student disciplinary process.

School Reports and Teacher Recommendations
------------------------------------------

### Secondary School Report

The secondary school report is a required form that is submitted by your school counselor or another school leader. This
form gives an overview of the student's academic record. It includes the applicant's academic transcript(s), a letter of
recommendation, and a school profile (if available). If a counselor is unable to submit a letter of recommendation for
the applicant, another teacher or school leader may submit an additional recommendation letter.

### Midyear School Report

When you apply, your school counselor will often send your transcript with few or no senior year course grades included.
That is why the midyear school report is required - to allow us to review your performance in the first half of your
senior year coursework**.**The midyear school report must be completed by your school counselor or other school
official. Please request that the midyear school report is completed and returned to our office as soon as possible.

### Midyear School Report FAQs

*   #### What if I'm applying Restrictive Early Action and I don't have my midyear grades yet?

    Restrictive Early Action applicants are not required to submit the midyear report by the November 1 deadline. If you
    applied Restrictive Early Action and are deferred to Regular Decision, please submit the midyear report and
    transcript in February, or as soon as your midyear grades are available.

*   #### I'm an international student and my academic year is different. Do I still need to submit the midyear report?

    If you study the IB curriculum or the A-level curriculum, then we expect that your school will send predicted
    grades, based on your current classroom work and the results of any internal or mock exams you have taken up to that
    point. If your school does not issue official or predicted midyear grades for your final year of school, then you do
    not need to submit the midyear report form, although the item may remain on your checklist.

*   #### What if I have already graduated from high school?

    If you have already graduated from high school, you should ignore the midyear report requirement (though the item
    may remain on your Checklist in the Applicant Portal) and simply ask your school to send a final school report if
    you have not already done so.

### Teacher Evaluations

Ask two teachers in different academic subjects who know you well to complete the Teacher Recommendation forms (which
includes an evaluation form and a letter of recommendation). If you wish to submit additional letters of recommendation,
you can do so after you submit your application. In your application confirmation email, there will be a personalized
link to send to your recommenders.

*   #### What courses should I take to prepare for applying to Harvard?

    There is no “one size fits all” rule about which curriculum to study during secondary school years. Students should
    challenge themselves by taking courses deemed appropriate by their teachers and counselors. But some students
    believe that “more is always better” when it comes to AP, IB or other advanced courses.

    While some students prosper academically and personally by taking large numbers of such courses, others benefit from
    a more balanced approach that allows them additional time for extracurricular and personal development. Even the
    best students can be negatively affected by taking too many courses at once, and might benefit instead from writing,
    reading or research projects on subjects of great interest to them.

    To learn more, read our Guide to Preparing for College. To avoid the “burnout” often seen among secondary school
    students, please refer to our
    article, [Time Out or Burn Out for the Next Generation](/admissions/apply/first-year-applicants/considering-gap-year)
    .

*   #### Is there a specific math requirement?

    Applicants to Harvard should excel in a challenging high school math sequence corresponding to their educational
    interests and aspirations. We recommend that applicants take four years of math courses in high school. Ideally,
    these math courses will focus on conceptual understanding, promote higher-order thinking, and encourage students to
    use mathematical reasoning to critically examine the world. Examples include rigorous and relevant courses in
    computer science, statistics and its subfields, mathematical modeling, calculus, and other advanced math subjects.

    Students’ math records are viewed holistically, and no specific course is required. Specifically, calculus is not a
    requirement for admission to Harvard. We understand that applicants do not have the same opportunities and course
    offerings in their high schools. Moreover, many programs of study at Harvard do not require knowledge of calculus.
    We encourage applicants to take the courses that are available to them and aligned with their interests and goals.

    Students intending to study engineering, computer science, physics, mathematics, statistics or other fields where
    calculus is needed may benefit from taking calculus in high school. However, students at Harvard can still pursue
    such fields by starting with one of our introductory calculus classes that has no high school calculus prerequisite.
    On balance, we encourage all students to master foundational mathematical material instead of rushing through any of
    the more advanced courses.

### Final School Report and Transcripts

All admitted students who choose to enroll are required to send a Final School Report and transcript as soon as their
final grades become available – **no later than July 1**. The Final School Report and transcript should be completed and
sent by a school counselor or other school official through:

* Credential exchange (preferred method)
    * Parchment
    * Scrip-Safe
    * Naviance Network
* Via the application system through which you applied
    * Common Application
    * Coalition/Scoir Application

IB students should send their final results as soon as they are released in mid-July. We will expect to see final A
levels results by mid-August.

**We are unable to accept a transcript as an email attachment.**

Standardized Test Scores
------------------------

Harvard College will require the submission of standardized test scores from applicants for admission as part of the
comprehensive application process that takes a whole-student approach.

The College will accept the SAT or ACT to meet the standardized testing requirement. In exceptional cases when those
tests are not accessible, one of the following can meet the requirement:

1. AP exam results
2. IB Actual or Predicted Scores3. GCSE/A-Level Actual or Predicted Results4. National Leaving Exams Results or
                                                                              Predictions

### Standardized Testing FAQs

*   #### Can I self-report my test scores?

    Yes. Applicants may provide self-reported SAT and ACT test scores (including Subject Tests, Advanced Placement, IB,
    etc.). Admitted students who decide to enroll at Harvard College will be required to submit official test scores.

*   #### How do I send my test scores?

    You are free to use the College Board Score Choice option or the similar option offered by the ACT. Our official
    codes are 3434 for the College Board SAT Reasoning Tests and 1840 for the ACT if you are submitting official test
    scores as part of your application.

    * [How to send your SAT scores](http://sat.collegeboard.org/scores)

    * [How to send your ACT scores](http://www.actstudent.org/scores/send/)


*   #### Are there test score "cutoffs"?

    There are no score cutoffs, and we do not admit “by the numbers.” For the ACT, we will evaluate your highest
    composite score and any other scores you choose to share with us. We take into account your educational background
    when reviewing your scores.

*   #### How should I prepare for standardized tests?

    Our admissions committee understands that opportunities to prepare for standardized tests vary greatly for students
    of different socioeconomic backgrounds. You may find it helpful to utilize free-test prep
    from [Khan Academy](Khan Academy)
    or join a free SAT bootcamp on [Schoolhouse.world](https://schoolhouse.world/course/sat)
    . The ACT provides sample tests to practice. Such free programs could help students from under-resourced schools by
    providing the academic tools that will serve them well on standardized tests and also in college. Students can also
    do well by studying widely and deeply on their own with the help of family, school, or community organizations.

*   #### What do standardized tests and grades indicate about academic preparation for college?

    SAT and ACT tests are better predictors of Harvard grades than high school grades. However, admission officers
    understand that not all students attend well-resourced schools throughout their lives, and that those who come from
    modest economic backgrounds or first-generation college families may have had fewer opportunities to prepare for
    standardized tests.

    High school grades in a rigorous academic program can also be helpful in assessing readiness for college courses,
    but the thousands of secondary schools around the country and the world employ various high school curricula and a
    wide range of grading systems - and some have no grades at all. Other students have been homeschooled or prepared
    for college by taking part in multiple schooling opportunities both in person and electronic.

    Given the wide variation in how students prepare for Harvard – as well as the fact that most applicants and admitted
    students have outstanding academic records – it is difficult for high school grades to differentiate individual
    applications. That does not mean that high school grades are unimportant. Students who come to Harvard have done
    well day to day in their high school studies, providing a crucial foundation for academic success in college,
    including a 97% - 98% graduation rate.

    Each application to Harvard is read with great care, keeping in mind that talent is everywhere, but opportunity and
    access are not.

*   #### How will Harvard evaluate the new digital SAT?

    The College Board's shift to a digital delivery of the SAT will not impact the way in which Harvard reviews test
    scores within applications.
    Please[visit the College Board FAQs](https://satsuite.collegeboard.org/digital/faq "https://satsuite.collegeboard.org/digital/faq")
    for more information.

Supplemental Materials
----------------------

Our standard application materials typically give us ample information for making admission decisions. However, we
recognize you may have truly exceptional talents or achievements you wish to share, and we want you to have every
opportunity to best represent yourself.

At the discretion of the Admissions Committee, supplementary materials—such as music recordings, artwork, or selected
samples of academic work—may be evaluated by faculty. These materials are entirely optional.

### Material Types

*   #### How to submit documents and articles

    Scholarly articles, research, creative writing or other documents of which you are the primary author should be
    submitted in the Upload Materials section of the [Applicant Portal](https://apply.college.harvard.edu/apply/status)
    . This is the most efficient and direct method of submitting these materials, because they will be added directly to
    your official application. All submissions should include a list of any individuals with whom you collaborated in
    the production of the work. If appropriate, please identify your research sponsor, mentor, and/or laboratory or
    research group leader and provide a short description of your particular contribution to the work.

*   #### How to submit media (video, audio, or images)

    You may submit optional supplementary media materials (e.g. videos, audio recordings, or images) electronically
    via [Slideroom](https://harvard.slideroom.com/#/Login)
    . Details for submissions in art, dance or choreography, musical performance or composition, will be found on the
    Slideroom website. There is a small submission fee, but if this fee causes you economic hardship, you may request a
    fee waiver at the point of submission. You may also contact us to request a fee waiver.

    If you encounter technical difficulties on Slideroom, you may submit a document via your portal with YouTube video
    links. Our team may follow up to request a Slideroom submission at a later
    time.*   #### Should I submit other academic materials?

             Harvard accepts other standardized tests or other academic credentials if you choose to submit them. In any
             admissions process, additional information can be helpful. For example, Advanced Placement, International
             Baccalaureate, A-levels, national leaving examinations, national or international contests, early high
             school assessment scores such as the PSAT or pre-ACT, or courses taken outside your school during the
             school year or summer are just some examples of information that could be submitted. Subject Tests and the
             essay portion of the SAT have been terminated, except in certain special circumstances. Harvard admission
             officers review all materials that an applicant submits, so if you’ve already taken Subject Tests or the
             essay portion of the SAT, you may still submit them along with your other application materials.

### Frequently Asked Questions

*   #### How will the delayed FAFSA processing impact admissions or financial aid decisions?

    Do not worry! Delayed FAFSA submissions will not impact the timing of admissions or financial aid decisions at
    Harvard. If you are admitted and if you have submitted the CSS Profile and all necessary tax returns to IDOC by our
    financial aid application deadline, your financial aid decision will be available at the time of admission. As
    always, if you complete those parts of your financial aid application after the deadline, there is no penalty or
    reduction in the amount of aid you can receive, but you may experience a delay in receiving your aid decision.

*   #### Paying the admissions application fee is a hardship for my family. Can I get a waiver?

    We are committed to making the application process accessible for all students. If the admissions application fee
    presents a hardship for you or your family and you plan on applying for financial aid, the fee will be waived.
    Please follow the steps below to request a fee waiver:

    **Common Application**

    1. Confirm that you meet at least one of the indicators of economic need and then select “Yes” to the prompt “You
       are eligible for application fee waivers if you meet one or more of the following criteria."
    2. Complete the fee waiver signature.
    **Coalition Application, Powered by Scoir**

    1. Confirm that you meet at least one of the indicators of economic need listed in the Fee Waiver section of your
       Profile.
    2. **If you do not meet one of the indicators of economic need, you may enter the Harvard-specific fee waiver code
       on the payment page: JH3S5Q2LX9**

    **Transfer Applicants**

    1. Please see
       the [Transfer Application Requirements](https://college.harvard.edu/admissions/apply/transfer-applicants)
       for information about requesting a transfer application fee waiver.

*   #### What admissions criteria do you use?

    There is no formula for gaining admission to Harvard. Academic accomplishment in high school is important, but the
    Admissions Committee also considers many other criteria, such as community involvement, leadership and distinction
    in extracurricular activities, and personal qualities and character. We rely on teachers, counselors, and alumni to
    share information with us about an applicant's strength of character, their ability to overcome adversity, and other
    personal qualities.

*   #### How can I add new accomplishments/awards/accolades to my submitted application?

    We understand that you might receive new recognitions or awards after you’ve submitted your application. We welcome
    the submission of this additional notable information. You may upload information about notable accomplishments and
    awards using the [Applicant Portal](https://apply.college.harvard.edu/status)

We consider each application with care.

When reading an application, we get to know the person behind the numbers. We take into consideration your academic
achievements, extracurricular activities, personal qualities, and life experiences. Just as there is no typical Harvard
student, there is no ideal Harvard applicant. We look forward to learning more about you.

### Frequently asked questions about applying

*   #### Have my application materials been received? (Including Common Application forms, or supplemental materials)

    Upon receipt of your application, we will send you a confirmation email with instructions on how to access
    the[Applicant Portal](https://apply.college.harvard.edu/apply/status)
    . This portal allows you to view your record in our applicant database, to see which pieces of your application
    we've received and processed, and to make other changes to your application.

    The data is updated nightly from the main admissions database and has the most up-to-date information available from
    our office. If you have sent us required materials that are shown in your status as not received, it is possible
    that those documents are being processed (along with thousands of others) in our office and simply have not yet made
    it to your file. Though we can not track each individual's materials upon request, we will conduct a thorough
    scrutiny of all files prior to committee evaluations. You will be contacted if you are missing required documents,
    and you will be given the opportunity to re-submit them without penalty.

*   #### How can I add new accomplishments/awards/accolades to my submitted application?

    We understand that you might receive new recognitions or awards after you’ve submitted your application. We welcome
    the submission of this additional notable information. You may upload information about notable accomplishments and
    awards using the [Applicant Portal](https://apply.college.harvard.edu/status)
    .

*   #### When do I need to submit test scores if I want them considered in my application?

    If you are applying Restrictive Early Action, we would like your testing results by the end of October; however, you
    may submit the November series if needed.

    For Regular Decision, although it is possible to submit scores from tests taken as late as the February, we
    recommend that you submit testing as early as possible.

*   #### Do I need to complete an alumni interview for my first-year application?

    Applicants are assigned interviews at the discretion of the Admissions Committee, based, in part, on availability of
    alumni in your local area. Nearly 10,000 alumni/ae volunteers help us recruit students from all 50 states and around
    the world, but most areas do not have the capacity to interview all applicants. Your application is considered
    complete without an interview and will receive a full and thorough evaluation. In most cases, the Admissions
    Committee has sufficient information in the student’s application materials to reach an admissions decision. If the
    Committee would like more information about a student or has questions about any application materials, someone may
    reach out to schedule an interview.

beginning the process during the spring of Junior year in high school. Starting early will help to ease any stress that
might arise later in the process.

Overview
--------

Applying From Abroad

We welcome applications from all over the world. Our admissions and financial aid processes are the same for all
applicants - regardless of nationality or citizenship.

### Frequently asked questions

*   #### How do international students apply?

    The application requirements are the same for all applicants whether a student attends high school inside or outside
    the U.S. All first-year candidates must complete the[Common Application](http://www.commonapp.org/)or
    the[Coalition Application](http://coalitionapp.org/)along with the required supplements. We have no preference and
    each application is treated equally by the Admissions
    Committee.[View our detailed application requirements here](https://college.harvard.edu/admissions/apply/first-year-applicants/application-requirements)
    .

*   #### Do I have to take the TOEFL?

    A strong knowledge of English is essential for successful study at Harvard, including the ability to understand and
    express thoughts quickly and clearly. First-year and transfer applicants are **not required** to take an English
    proficiency exam, but you may submit scores if you wish to do
    so. [Visiting Undergraduate Students program](/admissions/apply/visiting-undergraduate-students "Visiting Undergraduate Students")
    applicants are required to take the TOEFL.

*   #### Are there quotas for international applicants?

    There are no quotas or limits of any kind at any point in the admissions process. All students are considered in the
    same pool for all places in the incoming class, regardless of citizenship or the secondary school they attend. A
    student's chances for admission and financial aid are not affected by citizenship or by the location of the school
    that the student attends.

*   #### Does Harvard offer admission application fee waivers to international students?

    We are committed to making the application process accessible for all students. If the admissions application fee
    presents a hardship for you or your family, the fee will be waived. You can request a fee waiver directly through
    the Common Application or the Coalition Application, Powered by Scoir, if you meet their respective indicators of
    economic need. If you do not meet these
    indicators, [please follow these instructions to learn how to get your fee waived](https://college.harvard.edu/resources/faq/paying-admissions-application-fee-hardship-my-family-can-i-get-waiver)
    . Requesting a fee waiver will not disadvantage your application in any way.

*   #### Will Harvard provide travel expenses for international students who receive financial aid?

    All students, American and international, who are on financial aid have a travel allowance included in their
    financial aid award to help cover the cost of travel to and from Cambridge. Overseas students are advised to seek
    information from the nearest U.S. Cultural Affairs Office about travel grants and other financial assistance
    available to qualified students from various foundations and from the U.S. government.

Common Questions
----------------

We are often asked by prospective students, “Do you count me as an international applicant?” Because all applicants
follow the same procedures and timetables and are eligible for the same financial aid, we do not need to categorize
individual applicants as either international or domestic. We have foreign citizens applying from American high schools
and American citizens applying from high schools around the world. When we refer to “international admissions,” we are
generally referring to applicants who apply from schools outside the United States as the documentation submitted by
those schools may differ substantially from that submitted by an American high school and may require specialized
knowledge.

Please note that we do not have quotas or limits based on either citizenship or location of high school. Furthermore,
admissions decisions are made without regard to whether an applicant has applied for financial aid, even if the
applicant is a foreign citizen.

The Harvard Club of the UK has created a[website to answer specific questions](http://www.harvard-ukadmissions.co.uk/)
for those applying from the United Kingdom. You may find it a useful source of supplemental information.

Financial Aid
-------------

Our[financial aid policies](/financial-aid/how-aid-works "How Aid Works")are the same for all applicants, regardless of
nationality or citizenship. All aid is based on financial need, and admissions decisions are made without regard to
whether an applicant has applied for financial assistance. Harvard meets each student’s demonstrated need.

Standardized Tests
------------------

Harvard will accept the SAT or ACT to meet the standardized testing requirement. In exceptional cases, when those are
not accessible for a student, one of the following can meet the requirement:

* AP exam results* IB Actual or Predicted Scores
* GCSE/A-Level Actual or Predicted Results
* National Leaving Exams Results or Predictions

English language proficiency examinations such as the TOEFL, IELTS and Duolingo cannot be used to meet the standardized
testing requirement, though students are welcome to submit them for review as part of their application materials.

Students may self report their standardized test scores.

If the cost of taking the SAT or ACT is of concern, keep in mind that both the College Board and ACT provide fee waivers
to some domestic students from low-income families. Students who are non-US citizens attending secondary schools outside
the US are not typically eligible for SAT or ACT fee waivers. If applicants are ineligible for fee waivers, but still
face financial hardship in paying for a SAT or ACT, the Admissions Committee still encourages these students to apply.
We encourage students in this situation to take and submit results from other standardized tests to which they have
greater access. For instance, students lacking access to the SAT or ACT may submit AP or GCSE results, IB/A-level/other
national leaving exam predictions or results.

More information about standardized testing is included on
our[application requirements](/admissions/apply/application-requirements "Application Requirements")
page.English Language Proficiency
----------------------------

A strong knowledge of English is essential for successful study at Harvard, including the ability to understand and
express thoughts quickly and clearly. Although you are **not required** to take an English proficiency exam (such as the
TOEFL, IELTS, etc.), you may submit scores if you wish to do so.

International Interviews
------------------------

While we try to make alumni interviews as widely available as possible, we are unable to interview all applicants. The
absence of an interview will not adversely affect your candidacy. Please see our guide on what to expect after you apply
for information on arranging an interview.

Translated Materials
--------------------

If you choose to provide translated versions of your academic credentials or letters of recommendation, please note that
you should not translate the documents yourself. You do not need, however, to hire a professional translator. We are
happy to receive letters translated by an English teacher, for example. All translations should include the name of the
translator and his/her relationship to you. A copy of the original (untranslated) document should always accompany the
translated version.

                   For Regular Decision, although it is possible to submit scores from tests taken as late as the

Restrictive Early Action
------------------------

Applying to Harvard under the Restrictive Early Action program empowers you to make a college choice early. Early
applicants apply by November 1 and hear from us by mid-December.

If your record and accomplishments have been consistently strong over time, Restrictive Early Action may be an
attractive choice. You don’t have to commit to coming to Harvard, but you will learn earlier if it is an option for you.

### Consider if Restrictive Early Action is Right for You

*   #### What is Restrictive Early Action?

    Harvard welcomes interested applicants to apply under our Restrictive Early Action plan by November 1 in order to be
    notified of a decision in mid-December. Restrictive Early Action is a non-binding early program, signifying that if
    admitted, you are not obligated to attend, and have until May 1 to reply to our offer of admission.**IMPORTANT:**
    * If you are applying to Harvard under Restrictive Early Action, you may not apply to any other private institution
      under an Early Decision, Early Action, or Restrictive Early Action plan, or to a binding early program at a public
      university.
    * You are welcome to apply early to any public university, military academy, or university outside of the United
      States under a non-binding program.* Additionally, you are able to apply to other universities under their Regular Decision or Early Decision II programs.* If your application is deferred in the early action round, you mayapply to a binding early decisionprogram at another college (i.e.Early Decision II).
    * You may apply for scholarships or special academic programs with an early deadline at another institution, public
      or private, if the timing is proven to be a necessary aspect for consideration, and the outcome is non-binding.*
    Harvard will meet the full financial need of admitted students regardless of whether they apply Restrictive Early
    Action or Regular Decision.*   #### Is it easier to be accepted if I apply Restrictive Early Action?

                                   Harvard does not offer an advantage to students who apply early. While admit rates
                                   tend to be higher in Restrictive Early Action, this reflects the remarkable strength
                                   of the applicant pool rather than a benefit of application timing. For any individual
                                   student, the final decision likely would be comparable whether the student applies
                                   Restrictive Early Action or Regular Decision.

*   #### What are the benefits of applying Regular Decision?

    Regular Decision offers important practical advantages.

    1. You will have more time to edit and proofread your portions of the application, and more time for your teachers
       and counselors to become familiar with you before they write on your behalf.
    2. Your application may be strengthened by senior year extracurricular achievements, course selections, academic
       performance, or other important factors.
