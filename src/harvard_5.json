You will need to submit:\n\n*   Common Application or apply Coalition, Powered by Scoir. This includes:\n    *   Subsets of questions\n    *   An activities list\n    *   Personal essay ([Common Application prompts](https://www.commonapp.org/apply/essay-prompts)\n        , [Coalition Application prompts](https://www.coalitionforcollegeaccess.org/essays)\n        )\n*   Harvard College Questions for the Common Application or Coalition Application Harvard supplement. There are five required short-answer questions with 200 word limits for each\n*   $85 fee (or [request a fee waiver](https://college.harvard.edu/resources/faq/paying-admissions-application-fee-hardship-my-family-can-i-get-waiver)\n    )\n*   SAT or ACT - In exceptional cases when those tests are not accessible, one of the following can meet the requirement:   \n    *   AP exam results  \n    *   IB Actual or Predicted Scores   \n    *   GCSE/A-Level Actual or Predicted Results   \n    *   National Leaving Exams Results or Predictions\n*   AP or other examination results are not required, but may be submitted\n*   School Report (which includes a counselor letter) and high school transcript\n*   Teacher Recommendations (2)\n*   Midyear School Report (after your first semester grades)\n*   Final School Report (for admitted students only)\n\n[View detailed application requirements](/admissions/apply/application-requirements)\n\nApplication Timeline\n--------------------\n\nYou may apply to Harvard under either our Restrictive Early Action or our Regular Decision program, both of which allow you to compare admission and financial aid offers from other institutions and to wait until May 1 to make a final college choice.\n\nYour materials are due by the deadline for whichever round you choose; high school counselors may submit supporting materials up to a week after the deadline if necessary. \n\n*   Restrictive Early Action candidates apply by **November 1** and receive notification by **mid-December**. \n*   Regular Decision candidates apply by **January 1** and receive notification by the **end of March**.\n\nYou are welcome to apply to Harvard using the Common Application which opens August 1, or the Coalition Application, Powered by Scoir, which opens August 15.   \n   \n \n\n### First-year Timeline Questions\n\n*   #### View detailed application timeline\n    \n    **Spring or Summer  (prior to the year you apply)**   \n    Consider taking the following tests:\n    \n    SAT or ACT - Harvard requires the submission of standardized testing\n    \n    **Fall (of the year you apply)**  \n    As early in the fall as possible, please submit:\n    \n    *   Your online application to Harvard, via the Common Application or the Coalition Application, Powered by Scoir. This is needed to open your admissions file, track your documents, and set up a possible alumni interview. \n    *   The $85 application fee or a [fee waiver request](https://apply.college.harvard.edu/register/?id=afdcbaf7-c10f-4610-9b31-1bfe6ad9eac2)\n        . You may send the application supplements at a later date, preferably no later than 2 weeks after the application deadline.\n    \n    **October 31**  \n    Restrictive Early Action applicants: We request that you submit your required test scores by the end of October. However, you are still eligible to apply using the November series as they should reach us in time for consideration.\n    \n    **November 1**  \n    Restrictive Early Action applicants: Your portions of the application are due by November 1 at 11:59pm (your local time); high school counselors may submit supporting materials up to one week later if necessary.\n    \n    Also submit your financial aid application so that if you are admitted, we will be able to send you financial aid information in mid-December when decisions are released.\n    \n    **Early November**  \n    If you are applying Regular Decision, we recommend that you submit standardized test scores from the November series or earlier, though you may submit December scores (SAT) or February scores (ACT).\n    \n    **Mid-December**  \n    Restrictive Early Action applicants: Decisions released.\n    \n    **January 1**  \n    Your portions of the application are due by January 1 at 11:59pm (your local time); high school counselors may submit supporting materials up to one week later if necessary.\n    \n    **February 1**  \n    Notify the Admissions Office ([fileroom@fas.harvard.edu](mailto:fileroom@fas.harvard.edu)\n    ) if you have not received your application confirmation email.\n    \n    Submit your financial aid application (if still pending), so that if you are admitted, we will be able to send you financial aid information in late March when decisions are released.\n    \n    **Mid-February**  \n    Request that your school submit your Midyear School Report forms with your most recent grades.\n    \n    **End of March**  \n    First-year admission decisions released.\n    \n    **Early May**  \n    Reply deadline for admitted students. No deposit required.  \n     \n    \n*   #### How and when to submit ACT or SAT scores (for students submitting standardized test scores)\n    \n    You may self report your SAT and ACT test scores. Admitted students who decide to enroll at Harvard College and have submitted self-reported ACT or SAT test scores will be required to submit official test scores at the time of enrollment.\n    \n    If you are applying Restrictive Early Action, we would like your testing results by the end of October; however, you may submit the November series if needed.\n    \n    For Regular Decision, although it is possible to submit scores from tests taken as late as the February, we recommend that you submit testing as early as possible.\n    \n\n![](https://college.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/styles/billboard_image/public/2024-03/56_0.jpg?h=a141e9ea&itok=bDn25fbj)\n\nYou can afford Harvard\n----------------------\n\nIn just a few minutes, you can get a personalized estimate of your Harvard scholarship with our Net Price Calculator.\n\n[Net Price Calculator](/financial-aid/net-price-calculator)\n\nRestrictive Early Action\n------------------------\n\nApplying to Harvard under the Restrictive Early Action program empowers you to make a college choice early. Early applicants apply by November 1 and hear from us by mid-December. \n\nIf your record and accomplishments have been consistently strong over time, Restrictive Early Action may be an attractive choice. You don’t have to commit to coming to Harvard, but you will learn earlier if it is an option for you.\n\n### Consider if Restrictive Early Action is Right for You\n\n*   #### What is Restrictive Early Action?\n    \n    Harvard welcomes interested applicants to apply under our Restrictive Early Action plan by November 1 in order to be notified of a decision in mid-December. Restrictive Early Action is a non-binding early program, signifying that if admitted, you are not obligated to attend, and have until May 1 to reply to our offer of admission. \n    \n    **IMPORTANT:** \n    \n    *   If you are applying to Harvard under Restrictive Early Action, you may not apply to any other private institution under an Early Decision, Early Action, or Restrictive Early Action plan, or to a binding early program at a public university.\n    *   You are welcome to apply early to any public university, military academy, or university outside of the United States under a non-binding program. \n    *   Additionally, you are able to apply to other universities under their Regular Decision or Early Decision II programs. \n    *   If your application is deferred in the early action round, you may apply to a binding early decision program at another college (i.e. Early Decision II).\n    *   You may apply for scholarships or special academic programs with an early deadline at another institution, public or private, if the timing is proven to be a necessary aspect for consideration, and the outcome is non-binding.  \n    *   Harvard will meet the full financial need of admitted students regardless of whether they apply Restrictive Early Action or Regular Decision. \n    \n*   #### Is it easier to be accepted if I apply Restrictive Early Action?\n    \n    Harvard does not offer an advantage to students who apply early. While admit rates tend to be higher in Restrictive Early Action, this reflects the remarkable strength of the applicant pool rather than a benefit of application timing. For any individual student, the final decision likely would be comparable whether the student applies Restrictive Early Action or Regular Decision.\n    \n*   #### What are the benefits of applying Regular Decision?\n    \n    Regular Decision offers important practical advantages.\n    \n    1.  You will have more time to edit and proofread your portions of the application, and more time for your teachers and counselors to become familiar with you before they write on your behalf.\n    2.  Your application may be strengthened by senior year extracurricular achievements, course selections, academic performance, or other important factors.\n    \n\nMailing Your Application\n------------------------\n\nApplications that are received in the mail will be treated equally by the Admissions Committee. However, applications submitted online are processed faster and allow your school officials to submit their part of your application online as well. Please choose one option only: either apply online or send an application through the mail.\\*\n\n###### \\*All application materials sent become the property of the Office of Admissions & Financial Aid.

However, you are still eligible to apply using the November series as they should reach us in time for consideration.\n    \n    **November 1**  \n    Restrictive Early Action applicants: Your portions of the application are due by November 1 at 11:59pm (your local time); high school counselors may submit supporting materials up to one week later if necessary.\n    \n    Also submit your financial aid application so that if you are admitted, we will be able to send you financial aid information in mid-December when decisions are released.\n    \n    **Early November**  \n    If you are applying Regular Decision, we recommend that you submit standardized test scores from the November series or earlier, though you may submit December scores (SAT) or February scores (ACT).\n    \n    **Mid-December**  \n    Restrictive Early Action applicants: Decisions released.\n    \n    **January 1**  \n    Your portions of the application are due by January 1 at 11:59pm (your local time); high school counselors may submit supporting materials up to one week later if necessary.\n    \n    **February 1**  \n    Notify the Admissions Office ([fileroom@fas.harvard.edu](mailto:fileroom@fas.harvard.edu)\n    ) if you have not received your application confirmation email.\n    \n    Submit your financial aid application (if still pending), so that if you are admitted, we will be able to send you financial aid information in late March when decisions are released.\n    \n    **Mid-February**  \n    Request that your school submit your Midyear School Report forms with your most recent grades.\n    \n    **End of March**  \n    First-year admission decisions released.\n    \n    **Early May**  \n    Reply deadline for admitted students. No deposit required.  \n     \n    \n*   #### How and when to submit ACT or SAT scores (for students submitting standardized test scores)\n    \n    You may self report your SAT and ACT test scores. Admitted students who decide to enroll at Harvard College and have submitted self-reported ACT or SAT test scores will be required to submit official test scores at the time of enrollment.\n    \n    If you are applying Restrictive Early Action, we would like your testing results by the end of October; however, you may submit the November series if needed.\n    \n    For Regular Decision, although it is possible to submit scores from tests taken as late as the February, we recommend that you submit testing as early as possible.\n    \n\n![](https://college.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/styles/billboard_image/public/2024-03/56_0.jpg?h=a141e9ea&itok=bDn25fbj)\n\nYou can afford Harvard\n----------------------\n\nIn just a few minutes, you can get a personalized estimate of your Harvard scholarship with our Net Price Calculator.\n\n[Net Price Calculator](/financial-aid/net-price-calculator)\n\nRestrictive Early Action\n------------------------\n\nApplying to Harvard under the Restrictive Early Action program empowers you to make a college choice early. Early applicants apply by November 1 and hear from us by mid-December. \n\nIf your record and accomplishments have been consistently strong over time, Restrictive Early Action may be an attractive choice. You don’t have to commit to coming to Harvard, but you will learn earlier if it is an option for you.\n\n### Consider if Restrictive Early Action is Right for You\n\n*   #### What is Restrictive Early Action?\n    \n    Harvard welcomes interested applicants to apply under our Restrictive Early Action plan by November 1 in order to be notified of a decision in mid-December. Restrictive Early Action is a non-binding early program, signifying that if admitted, you are not obligated to attend, and have until May 1 to reply to our offer of admission. \n    \n    **IMPORTANT:** \n    \n    *   If you are applying to Harvard under Restrictive Early Action, you may not apply to any other private institution under an Early Decision, Early Action, or Restrictive Early Action plan, or to a binding early program at a public university.\n    *   You are welcome to apply early to any public university, military academy, or university outside of the United States under a non-binding program. \n    *   Additionally, you are able to apply to other universities under their Regular Decision or Early Decision II programs. \n    *   If your application is deferred in the early action round, you may apply to a binding early decision program at another college (i.e. Early Decision II).\n    *   You may apply for scholarships or special academic programs with an early deadline at another institution, public or private, if the timing is proven to be a necessary aspect for consideration, and the outcome is non-binding.  \n    *   Harvard will meet the full financial need of admitted students regardless of whether they apply Restrictive Early Action or Regular Decision. \n    \n*   #### Is it easier to be accepted if I apply Restrictive Early Action?\n    \n    Harvard does not offer an advantage to students who apply early. While admit rates tend to be higher in Restrictive Early Action, this reflects the remarkable strength of the applicant pool rather than a benefit of application timing. For any individual student, the final decision likely would be comparable whether the student applies Restrictive Early Action or Regular Decision.\n    \n*   #### What are the benefits of applying Regular Decision?\n    \n    Regular Decision offers important practical advantages.\n    \n    1.  You will have more time to edit and proofread your portions of the application, and more time for your teachers and counselors to become familiar with you before they write on your behalf.\n    2.  Your application may be strengthened by senior year extracurricular achievements, course selections, academic performance, or other important factors.\n    \n\nMailing Your Application\n------------------------\n\nApplications that are received in the mail will be treated equally by the Admissions Committee. However, applications submitted online are processed faster and allow your school officials to submit their part of your application online as well. Please choose one option only: either apply online or send an application through the mail.\\*\n\n###### \\*All application materials sent become the property of the Office of Admissions & Financial Aid.
