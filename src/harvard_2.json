Through our liberal arts and sciences curriculum, you'll discover how to use your passions to build a bright future.\n\n### Frequently Asked Questions\n\n*   #### How will the delayed FAFSA processing impact admissions or financial aid decisions?\n    \n    Do not worry! Delayed FAFSA submissions will not impact the timing of admissions or financial aid decisions at Harvard. If you are admitted and if you have submitted the CSS Profile and all necessary tax returns to IDOC by our financial aid application deadline, your financial aid decision will be available at the time of admission. As always, if you complete those parts of your financial aid application after the deadline, there is no penalty or reduction in the amount of aid you can receive, but you may experience a delay in receiving your aid decision.\n    \n*   #### Paying the admissions application fee is a hardship for my family. Can I get a waiver?\n    \n    We are committed to making the application process accessible for all students. If the admissions application fee presents a hardship for you or your family and you plan on applying for financial aid, the fee will be waived. Please follow the steps below to request a fee waiver:\n    \n    **Common Application**\n    \n    1.  Confirm that you meet at least one of the indicators of economic need and then select “Yes” to the prompt “You are eligible for application fee waivers if you meet one or more of the following criteria.\"\n    2.  Complete the fee waiver signature. \n    \n    **Coalition Application, Powered by Scoir**\n    \n    1.  Confirm that you meet at least one of the indicators of economic need listed in the Fee Waiver section of your Profile.\n    2.  **If you do not meet one of the indicators of economic need, you may enter the Harvard-specific fee waiver code on the payment page: JH3S5Q2LX9**\n    \n    **Transfer Applicants**\n    \n    1.  Please see the [Transfer Application Requirements](https://college.harvard.edu/admissions/apply/transfer-applicants)\n         for information about requesting a transfer application fee waiver.\n    \n*   #### What admissions criteria do you use?\n    \n    There is no formula for gaining admission to Harvard. Academic accomplishment in high school is important, but the Admissions Committee also considers many other criteria, such as community involvement, leadership and distinction in extracurricular activities, and personal qualities and character. We rely on teachers, counselors, and alumni to share information with us about an applicant's strength of character, their ability to overcome adversity, and other personal qualities.\n    \n*   #### How can I add new accomplishments/awards/accolades to my submitted application?\n    \n    We understand that you might receive new recognitions or awards after you’ve submitted your application. We welcome the submission of this additional notable information. You may upload information about notable accomplishments and awards using the [Applicant Portal](https://apply.college.harvard.edu/status)\n    .\n    \n\nWhy Harvard\n-----------\n\nDiscover what makes Harvard the standard for liberal arts and sciences education.

Through our liberal arts and sciences curriculum, you'll discover how to use your passions to build a bright future.\n\n### Frequently Asked Questions\n\n*   #### How will the delayed FAFSA processing impact admissions or financial aid decisions?\n    \n    Do not worry! Delayed FAFSA submissions will not impact the timing of admissions or financial aid decisions at Harvard. If you are admitted and if you have submitted the CSS Profile and all necessary tax returns to IDOC by our financial aid application deadline, your financial aid decision will be available at the time of admission. As always, if you complete those parts of your financial aid application after the deadline, there is no penalty or reduction in the amount of aid you can receive, but you may experience a delay in receiving your aid decision.\n    \n*   #### Paying the admissions application fee is a hardship for my family. Can I get a waiver?\n    \n    We are committed to making the application process accessible for all students. If the admissions application fee presents a hardship for you or your family and you plan on applying for financial aid, the fee will be waived. Please follow the steps below to request a fee waiver:\n    \n    **Common Application**\n    \n    1.  Confirm that you meet at least one of the indicators of economic need and then select “Yes” to the prompt “You are eligible for application fee waivers if you meet one or more of the following criteria.\"\n    2.  Complete the fee waiver signature. \n    \n    **Coalition Application, Powered by Scoir**\n    \n    1.  Confirm that you meet at least one of the indicators of economic need listed in the Fee Waiver section of your Profile.\n    2.  **If you do not meet one of the indicators of economic need, you may enter the Harvard-specific fee waiver code on the payment page: JH3S5Q2LX9**\n    \n    **Transfer Applicants**\n    \n    1.  Please see the [Transfer Application Requirements](https://college.harvard.edu/admissions/apply/transfer-applicants)\n         for information about requesting a transfer application fee waiver.\n    \n*   #### What admissions criteria do you use?\n    \n    There is no formula for gaining admission to Harvard. Academic accomplishment in high school is important, but the Admissions Committee also considers many other criteria, such as community involvement, leadership and distinction in extracurricular activities, and personal qualities and character. We rely on teachers, counselors, and alumni to share information with us about an applicant's strength of character, their ability to overcome adversity, and other personal qualities.\n    \n*   #### How can I add new accomplishments/awards/accolades to my submitted application?\n    \n    We understand that you might receive new recognitions or awards after you’ve submitted your application. We welcome the submission of this additional notable information. You may upload information about notable accomplishments and awards using the [Applicant Portal](https://apply.college.harvard.edu/status)\n    .\n    \n\nWhy Harvard\n-----------\n\nDiscover what makes Harvard the standard for liberal arts and sciences education.
