We take into consideration your academic achievements, extracurricular activities, personal qualities, and life experiences. Just as there is no typical Harvard student, there is no ideal Harvard applicant. We look forward to learning more about you.\n\n### Frequently asked questions about applying\n\n*   #### Have my application materials been received? (Including Common Application forms, or supplemental materials)\n    \n    Upon receipt of your application, we will send you a confirmation email with instructions on how to access the [Applicant Portal](https://apply.college.harvard.edu/apply/status)\n    . This portal allows you to view your record in our applicant database, to see which pieces of your application we've received and processed, and to make other changes to your application.\n    \n    The data is updated nightly from the main admissions database and has the most up-to-date information available from our office. If you have sent us required materials that are shown in your status as not received, it is possible that those documents are being processed (along with thousands of others) in our office and simply have not yet made it to your file. Though we can not track each individual's materials upon request, we will conduct a thorough scrutiny of all files prior to committee evaluations. You will be contacted if you are missing required documents, and you will be given the opportunity to re-submit them without penalty.\n    \n*   #### How can I add new accomplishments/awards/accolades to my submitted application?\n    \n    We understand that you might receive new recognitions or awards after you’ve submitted your application. We welcome the submission of this additional notable information. You may upload information about notable accomplishments and awards using the [Applicant Portal](https://apply.college.harvard.edu/status)\n    .\n    \n*   #### When do I need to submit test scores if I want them considered in my application?\n    \n    If you are applying Restrictive Early Action, we would like your testing results by the end of October; however, you may submit the November series if needed.\n    \n    For Regular Decision, although it is possible to submit scores from tests taken as late as the February, we recommend that you submit testing as early as possible.\n    \n*   #### Do I need to complete an alumni interview for my first-year application?\n    \n    Applicants are assigned interviews at the discretion of the Admissions Committee, based, in part, on availability of alumni in your local area. Nearly 10,000 alumni/ae volunteers help us recruit students from all 50 states and around the world, but most areas do not have the capacity to interview all applicants. Your application is considered complete without an interview and will receive a full and thorough evaluation. In most cases, the Admissions Committee has sufficient information in the student’s application materials to reach an admissions decision. If the Committee would like more information about a student or has questions about any application materials, someone may reach out to schedule an interview.\n    \n\nStarting an Application\n-----------------------\n\nFor all first-year and transfer applicants, your first step will be to fill out and submit an application. You can do so through the Common Application or the Coalition Application - Powered by Scoir. For first-year applicants, the Common Application opens on August 1 and the Coalition Application opens on August 15. For transfer applicants, both applications open on September 1. \n\nWe have no preference and each application is treated equally by the Admissions Committee. \n\n[Common Application](http://www.commonapp.org/)\n\n[Apply Coalition, Powered by Scoir](http://www.coalitionforcollegeaccess.org/)\n\nApplication Requirements\n------------------------\n\nAll applicants—both international and U.S. candidates, first-year and transfer—**must complete** the following application components:\n\n*   [Common Application](http://www.commonapp.org/)\n     or apply [Coalition, Powered by Scoir](https://app.scoir.com/app/signup/2100353)\n    \n*   Harvard College Questions for the Common Application, or Coalition Application Harvard supplement\n*   $85 fee (or [request a fee waiver](https://college.harvard.edu/resources/faq/paying-admissions-application-fee-hardship-my-family-can-i-get-waiver)\n    )\n*   SAT or ACT (with or without writing) \n*   Optional: AP or other examination results\n\n**For first-year:**\n\n*   School Report (which includes a counselor letter) and high school transcript\n*   Teacher Report (2)\n*   Midyear School Report (after your first semester grades)\n*   Final School Report (for admitted students only)\n\n**For transfer:**\n\n*   College/Dean’s/Registrar’s report\n*   Official College Transcript\n*   College Instructor Recommendations (2)\n*   Official High School Transcript\n\nClick below to learn more about each component. \n\nNo student with a bachelor's degree or other first university degree from any other university, whether American or foreign, is eligible for admission to Harvard College. Students interested in continuing their studies beyond the bachelor's degree might wish to consider one of the [12 Harvard University graduate schools](https://www.harvard.edu/schools)\n. \n\n[First-Year Applicants](/admissions/apply/first-year-applicants)\n\n[Transfer Applicants](/admissions/apply/transfer-applicants)\n\n[Visiting Undergraduate Students](/admissions/apply/visiting-undergraduate-students)\n\nTimeline\n--------\n\n### Timeline\n\nWe encourage you to start planning for your college applications as early as possible. For many students, this means beginning the process during the spring of Junior year in high school. Starting early will help to ease any stress that might arise later in the process.\n\n#### Quick Links\n\n*   [First-Year Application Timeline](/admissions/apply/first-year-applicants)\n    \n*   [Transfer Application Timeline](/admissions/apply/transfer-applicants)\n    \n*   [Visiting Undergraduate Students Timeline](/admissions/apply/visiting-undergraduate-students)\n    \n*   [Preparing for College](/guides/preparing-college)\n    \n\n### Admissions Deadlines\n\n#### November 1\n\nRestrictive Early Action application deadline - [learn more about Restrictive Early Action](http://college.harvard.edu/admissions/apply/first-year-applicants#restrictive-early-action)\n.\n\n#### January 1\n\nRegular Decision application deadline\n\n#### March 1\n\nTransfer application deadline\n\n[Read our application tips](https://college.harvard.edu/guides/application-tips)\n\n![A student climbs Widener Library steps pn the way to study.](https://college.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/styles/billboard_image/public/2024-03/Harvard-University-Admissions-285.jpg?h=4fb703e6&itok=8rlZ43dx)\n\nApplication Tips\n----------------\n\nGet step-by-step tips on filling out your college application.

We take into consideration your academic achievements, extracurricular activities, personal qualities, and life experiences. Just as there is no typical Harvard student, there is no ideal Harvard applicant. We look forward to learning more about you.\n\n### Frequently asked questions about applying\n\n*   #### Have my application materials been received? (Including Common Application forms, or supplemental materials)\n    \n    Upon receipt of your application, we will send you a confirmation email with instructions on how to access the [Applicant Portal](https://apply.college.harvard.edu/apply/status)\n    . This portal allows you to view your record in our applicant database, to see which pieces of your application we've received and processed, and to make other changes to your application.\n    \n    The data is updated nightly from the main admissions database and has the most up-to-date information available from our office. If you have sent us required materials that are shown in your status as not received, it is possible that those documents are being processed (along with thousands of others) in our office and simply have not yet made it to your file. Though we can not track each individual's materials upon request, we will conduct a thorough scrutiny of all files prior to committee evaluations. You will be contacted if you are missing required documents, and you will be given the opportunity to re-submit them without penalty.\n    \n*   #### How can I add new accomplishments/awards/accolades to my submitted application?\n    \n    We understand that you might receive new recognitions or awards after you’ve submitted your application. We welcome the submission of this additional notable information. You may upload information about notable accomplishments and awards using the [Applicant Portal](https://apply.college.harvard.edu/status)\n    .\n    \n*   #### When do I need to submit test scores if I want them considered in my application?\n    \n    If you are applying Restrictive Early Action, we would like your testing results by the end of October; however, you may submit the November series if needed.\n    \n    For Regular Decision, although it is possible to submit scores from tests taken as late as the February, we recommend that you submit testing as early as possible.\n    \n*   #### Do I need to complete an alumni interview for my first-year application?\n    \n    Applicants are assigned interviews at the discretion of the Admissions Committee, based, in part, on availability of alumni in your local area. Nearly 10,000 alumni/ae volunteers help us recruit students from all 50 states and around the world, but most areas do not have the capacity to interview all applicants. Your application is considered complete without an interview and will receive a full and thorough evaluation. In most cases, the Admissions Committee has sufficient information in the student’s application materials to reach an admissions decision. If the Committee would like more information about a student or has questions about any application materials, someone may reach out to schedule an interview.\n    \n\nStarting an Application\n-----------------------\n\nFor all first-year and transfer applicants, your first step will be to fill out and submit an application. You can do so through the Common Application or the Coalition Application - Powered by Scoir. For first-year applicants, the Common Application opens on August 1 and the Coalition Application opens on August 15. For transfer applicants, both applications open on September 1. \n\nWe have no preference and each application is treated equally by the Admissions Committee. \n\n[Common Application](http://www.commonapp.org/)\n\n[Apply Coalition, Powered by Scoir](http://www.coalitionforcollegeaccess.org/)\n\nApplication Requirements\n------------------------\n\nAll applicants—both international and U.S. candidates, first-year and transfer—**must complete** the following application components:\n\n*   [Common Application](http://www.commonapp.org/)\n     or apply [Coalition, Powered by Scoir](https://app.scoir.com/app/signup/2100353)\n    \n*   Harvard College Questions for the Common Application, or Coalition Application Harvard supplement\n*   $85 fee (or [request a fee waiver](https://college.harvard.edu/resources/faq/paying-admissions-application-fee-hardship-my-family-can-i-get-waiver)\n    )\n*   SAT or ACT (with or without writing) \n*   Optional: AP or other examination results\n\n**For first-year:**\n\n*   School Report (which includes a counselor letter) and high school transcript\n*   Teacher Report (2)\n*   Midyear School Report (after your first semester grades)\n*   Final School Report (for admitted students only)\n\n**For transfer:**\n\n*   College/Dean’s/Registrar’s report\n*   Official College Transcript\n*   College Instructor Recommendations (2)\n*   Official High School Transcript\n\nClick below to learn more about each component. \n\nNo student with a bachelor's degree or other first university degree from any other university, whether American or foreign, is eligible for admission to Harvard College.
